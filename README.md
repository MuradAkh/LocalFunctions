[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/MuradAkh/Qicc.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/MuradAkh/Qicc)

Qicc is a verification tool that enables proving assertions in C programs quicker. Qicc utilizes CBMC but can be modified to work with other verification tools. 

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/MuradAkh/Qicc/wiki) for more information.

For instructions on how to install and run Qicc, see [Getting Sarted](https://github.com/MuradAkh/Qicc/wiki/2.-Getting-Started)
